            <p class="p">
              Clients interact with servers through http. When visiting a webpage an HTTP request is sent to the server and the server finds the appropriate HTML doc and sents it back to the computer then the web browser interprets and displays it.

          <h2 class="h2">Notes on Inline or Block</h2>
            <p class="p">
              HTML elements are either inline or block. Elements form an invisible block around the content inside them.

          <h2 class="h2">Notes on Tree Like Structures</h2>
            <p class="p">
              Tree like structure identifies how in HTML boxes are inside of boxes. The more indented an element is the more deeply nested its corresponding box is. When programmers talk about Document Object Models (DOM's) they are talking about the treelike structure of a webpage.

          <h2 class="h2">Notes on Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
            <p class="p">
              It is recommended to avoid repitition and to be consistent when working with CSS. CSS helps programmers control the style of related HTML elements by giving elements the same class name and specifying the style that should apply for the class.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
              You can have several CSS files or sheets that will be referenced in html and all of them will be used to find out the final or visible style for your page. Concept of most specific rule applied is what the word cascading means.  You go down and down into the rules until you find the one that best describes the elements and then that rule gets applied.

              <b>Selector</b> The name that you use in order to target the elements that are assigned to a class or ID attribute in the html.

              <b>Class</b> Refers to a group of elements that can be styled together.  Should not contain periods or punctuation marks.
